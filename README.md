# VSLAM Simulator

This project implements a Visual SLAM system split across two branches:
*   **`main`**: Contains the ORB-SLAM algorithm (VSLAM backend).
*   **`master`**: Contains a Raylib-based physics simulator.

The two components communicate via **ROS2**.

## Goal
The simulation will provide realistic IMU and camera data, which the ORB-SLAM system will// filepath: /home/puluboi/Documents/projects/orb_basic/README.md
